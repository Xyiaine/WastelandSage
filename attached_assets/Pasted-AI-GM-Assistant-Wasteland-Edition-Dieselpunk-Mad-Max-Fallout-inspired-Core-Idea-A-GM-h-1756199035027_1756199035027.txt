AI GM Assistant – Wasteland Edition

(Dieselpunk / Mad Max / Fallout inspired)

🎯 Core Idea

A GM helper app that:

Builds modular 4h RPG sessions (structure + pacing).

Generates context-aware random events.

Stores everything in a node-based scenario library (events, NPCs, factions, items, locations).

Alternates between two adventure creators:

On the Road (fast, survival, chaos)

City / Camp (slow, intrigue, factions)

Uses AI API to keep events consistent with past nodes.

🗂️ Main Features
1. Session Builder

Default session split into 5 phases: Hook → Exploration → Rising Tension → Climax → Resolution.

Each phase pulls events from road/city creators depending on context.

GM can rearrange or skip phases.

2. Dual Adventure Creators

Two separate modules for different storytelling rhythms:

🚚 On the Road Creator

Generates fast-paced survival events (mutants, ambushes, storms, resource scarcity).

Pacing buttons: Accelerate (combat), Slow Down (exploration), Add Tension (scarcity/betrayal), Resolve (escape/showdown).

Events tie into nodes: convoys, raiders, wasteland hazards, fuel, broken vehicles.

🏙️ City / Camp Creator

Generates intrigue-driven events (faction politics, riots, betrayals, resource shortages).

Pacing buttons: Accelerate (riot/attack), Slow Down (social hook, trade), Add Tension (corruption, betrayal), Resolve (trial, coup, decision).

Events tie into nodes: factions, leaders, traders, bars, bunkers.

3. Node-Based Scenario Library 🕸️ (Core Backbone)

A knowledge graph that stores all scenario information.

Node Types:

Event Nodes → encounters, random triggers.

NPC Nodes → raiders, traders, warlords.

Faction Nodes → gangs, cults, barons.

Location Nodes → highways, bunkers, cities.

Item Nodes → fuel, relics, weapons.

Relationships:

Temporal (Event → Event timeline).

Spatial (Event → Location).

Factional (NPC → Faction, Faction → Location).

Ownership (NPC → Item).

Views:

Timeline Mode → chronological sequence of sessions/events.

Graph Mode → interactive network of nodes + links.

Management:

Auto-generated nodes from events.

Manual node editing (add/delete/merge).

AI suggestions for linking nodes (“This raider probably works for the Iron Vultures”).

4. Pacing Controls (Global)

Accelerate → insert conflict node.

Slow Down → insert roleplay node.

Add Tension → inject scarcity, betrayal, surprise.

Resolve → tie unresolved event nodes into conclusions.

Works in both Road + City creators, always feeding into the node graph.

5. AI API Integration

Input: current session phase, node graph, past session log, player actions.

Output: context-aware events consistent with ongoing story.

Modes:

Chaos Mode (Mad Max) → unpredictable, high-action events.

Continuity Mode (Fallout) → logical, story-consistent developments.

6. Timeline Manager

Logs all events into a session timeline.

Editable by GM (drag, reorder, delete).

Exportable (Markdown, PDF).

🛠️ Dev Considerations

Frontend:

UI needs:

Dual creators (Road/City).

Node graph view (interactive, zoomable).

Timeline view (sortable list).

Control buttons (Accelerate, Slow Down, Add Tension, Resolve).

Graph visualization library (e.g. D3.js, Cytoscape.js).

Backend:

Store nodes and relationships (Graph DB like Neo4j, or relational DB with adjacency).

API calls to AI service for event contextualization.

Event table system (modular packs).

AI Integration:

All event generation runs through AI API.

API must receive session state (nodes + timeline) to generate coherent results.

🚀 Example Workflow

GM starts session → chooses On the Road Creator.

Event generated: “Ambush by dune buggy raiders.”

Event Node created + linked to NPC Node (raider gang), Faction Node (Iron Vultures), Location Node (Wasteland Route 19).

GM presses Slow Down → scavenger NPC event is added.

New NPC Node created, linked to Location Node.

Later, group reaches a settlement → switch to City Creator.

Event generated: “Faction leader accuses PCs of theft.”

Event Node linked to Faction Node + NPC Node from earlier.

At end, GM exports timeline → recap shows continuity between road & city events.

🌍 Extensibility

Add-on event packs (Mutant Horror, Tech Relics, Faction Intrigue).

Procedural map integration (nodes linked to geography).

Multiplayer GM tools (co-op campaigns).

✅ In short:
This app is a dual-phase session builder (road vs. city), powered by an AI-aware node graph that stores everything, generates coherent events, and helps GMs maintain campaign continuity.
