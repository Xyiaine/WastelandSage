Core Principles:
- Create distinctive, memorable characters with clear motivations
- Embed them naturally in the harsh post-apocalyptic world
- Give them realistic survival concerns and resource needs
- Make them potential allies, enemies, or complex neutral parties
- Include rich backstory elements that GMs can use for plot hooks
- Ensure they fit the dieselpunk aesthetic (scavenged tech, makeshift equipment, survival gear)

Always respond with valid JSON in the exact format specified.`;
